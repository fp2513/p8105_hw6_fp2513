## Problem 1

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

Steps:

1.  Generate 5000 bootstrap samples

2.  Fit a linear regression model for each bootstrap sample where
    response is tmax and predictor is tmin

3.  For each bootstrap sample, calculate the R^2 and the logarithm of
    estimated coefficients multiplied

Boostrap function for 5000 samples

``` r
set.seed(123)

bootstrap_results = replicate(5000, {

sample_indices = sample(seq_len(nrow(weather_df)), replace = TRUE)
bootstrap_sample = weather_df[sample_indices, ]
  
  model = lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = bootstrap_sample)
  model_summary = summary(model)
  
  b0 = coef(model)[1]
  b1 = coef(model)[2]
  
  r_squared = model_summary$r.squared
  
  log_b0_b1 = log(b0 * b1)

  return(c(r_squared = r_squared, log_b0_b1 = log_b0_b1))
}, 

simplify = "matrix")

bootstrap_df = as.data.frame(t(bootstrap_results))
colnames(bootstrap_df) = c("R_squared", "log_b0_b1")
```

Plotting my results

``` r
ggplot(bootstrap_df, aes(x = R_squared)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of R-squared",
       x = "R-squared",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The histogram plot for the R^2 values resulting from the 5000 bootstrap
shows a unimodal distribution, centered around the mean of the bootstrap
R^2 values. Additionally, the mean of the bootstrap R^2 values should be
very close to the R^2 value of the original weather dataframe that we
bootstrapped 5000 samples from. Most R^2 values lie within a range
indicating a good fit of the linear model. The variability is due to the
resampling process of bootstrapping.

``` r
ggplot(bootstrap_df, aes(x = log_b0_b1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "green", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of log(b0^ * b1^)",
       x = "log(b0^ * b1^)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This distribution is somewhat symmetric, where the mean or median of the
bootstrap distribution (2.0) shows a clear central eestimate of the log
product of b0^ and b1^. This means that the combined effect of these two
parameters has a central tendancy.

We can also learn that from the sign of b0^ and b1^ product being a
positive value that this helps to reinforce the idea of a positive
relationship between tmin and tmax

``` r
r_squared_ci = quantile(bootstrap_df$R_squared, c(0.025, 0.975))
print(paste("95% CI for R^2:", round(r_squared_ci[1], 4), "-", round(r_squared_ci[2], 4)))
```

    ## [1] "95% CI for R^2: 0.8946 - 0.9271"

``` r
log_b0_b1_ci = quantile(bootstrap_df$log_b0_b1, c(0.025, 0.975))
print(paste("95% CI for log(b0 * b1):", round(log_b0_b1_ci[1], 4), "-", round(log_b0_b1_ci[2], 4)))
```

    ## [1] "95% CI for log(b0 * b1): 1.9642 - 2.0584"

## Problem 2

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv(file = "data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("NA", ",", ".")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Closed by arrest"), 1, 0),  
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)  
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),  
    !is.na(victim_age),  
    !city_state %in% c('Dallas, TX', 'Phoenix, AZ', 'Kansas City, MO', 'Tulsa, AL')  
  )
```
